After application is started, users will first be prompted to request which algorithm they'd like to generate the maze (Recursive Backtracker Algorithm or Prim's Algorithm)

Next, users will be prompted to request how large they'd like the maze to be (ranging from 20x20 tiles to 100x100 tiles)

Finally, users will be prompted to request which algorithm they'd like to solve the maze (Dijkstra's Algorithm or Depth First Search)
